## Dynamic GPU Detection and Configuration

Celeris starts by detecting available GPUs, their capabilities, and configuring the runtime environment accordingly. This ensures that the library can automatically adapt to the hardware specifications, such as compute capability and available memory.

- **Key Features:**
  - Automatic GPU detection with detailed property reporting.
  - Environment variables set for JIT compilation based on compute capability.

## Memory Management and Workspace Optimization

Efficient memory management is critical for high-performance GPU operations. Celeris implements memory pooling and workspace management to optimize the allocation and reuse of GPU memory.

- **Key Features:**
  - Configurable workspace size tailored to different GPU memories.
  - Memory pooling to reduce allocation overhead.

## Optimized Kernel Launch and Thread Configuration

Kernel launch parameters, such as block size and grid size, are dynamically determined based on the input tensor's shape and GPU architectural features. This helps maximize occupancy and efficiency during computation.

- **Key Features:**
  - Optimal block size calculation based on tensor dimensions and warp size.
  - Grid size computation to fully utilize GPU cores.

## Mixed Precision and Tensor Core Utilization

For GPUs that support it, Celeris leverages mixed precision operations (such as FP16 and BF16) to improve performance without sacrificing accuracy. The library uses tensor cores when available, dramatically accelerating computations like matrix multiplication.

- **Key Features:**
  - Automatic selection of optimal data type (FP32, FP16, or BF16) based on GPU capabilities.
  - Conditional use of tensor cores for supported operations.

## Benchmarking and Auto-Tuning

Celeris includes a suite of benchmark tools that help measure performance across different configurations and workloads. The benchmarking results feed back into the auto-tuning mechanisms, allowing the library to adjust kernel parameters and memory settings dynamically.

- **Key Features:**
  - Comprehensive benchmarking scripts to profile GEMM, element-wise operations, and activation functions.
  - Auto-tuning based on real-world performance metrics.

## Future Optimizations

While Celeris has made significant strides in optimizing GPU performance, there are several areas for future improvement:

- **Kernel Fusion:** Combining multiple operations into a single kernel to reduce memory bandwidth overhead.
- **Advanced Auto-Tuning:** Implementing more sophisticated algorithms to dynamically select optimal kernel parameters.
- **Custom CUDA Kernels:** Developing hand-tuned CUDA kernels for critical operations to further close the performance gap with proprietary libraries.
- **Enhanced Mixed Precision Support:** Further refining precision selection strategies to balance performance and numerical stability.
