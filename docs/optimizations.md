# Celeris Optimization Techniques

This document provides a detailed explanation of the optimization techniques implemented in the Celeris library. These techniques are inspired by DeepGEMM and are designed to maximize performance on NVIDIA GPUs.

## 1. Persistent Warp Specialization

### Overview
Persistent Warp Specialization is a technique that keeps warps active throughout the entire computation, reducing the overhead of warp scheduling and context switching.

### Implementation Details
- Each warp is assigned a specific portion of the output matrix
- Warps remain active throughout the entire computation
- Warps are specialized for specific tasks (e.g., loading data, computing)

### Code Example
```cpp
// Warp row and column
int warp_row = warp_id / ${warps_per_block_n};
int warp_col = warp_id % ${warps_per_block_n};

// Registers for accumulation
register ${data_type} accum[${warp_size_m}][${warp_size_n}];
```

### Performance Impact
- Reduces warp scheduling overhead
- Improves register utilization
- Increases overall throughput
- Typical speedup: 1.5-2x

## 2. Register Count Control

### Overview
Register Count Control is a technique that carefully manages the number of registers used by each thread to maximize occupancy and minimize register spilling.

### Implementation Details
- Use of `__launch_bounds__` to control register usage
- Explicit register variables with the `register` keyword
- Loop unrolling with `#pragma unroll`
- Use of `__restrict__` keyword for better register allocation

### Code Example
```cpp
// Control register usage with maxrregcount pragma
#pragma nv_diag_suppress 177  // Suppress unused variable warnings
extern "C" __global__ void __launch_bounds__(${block_threads}, ${min_blocks_per_sm}) gemm_kernel(
    const ${data_type}* __restrict__ A,
    const ${data_type}* __restrict__ B,
    ${data_type}* __restrict__ C,
    // ...
)
```

### Performance Impact
- Balances register usage and occupancy
- Minimizes register spilling
- Improves overall throughput
- Typical speedup: 1.1-1.3x

## 3. Overlapping Operations

### Overview
Overlapping Operations is a technique that overlaps computation and memory access to hide memory latency.

### Implementation Details
- Double buffering for shared memory
- Prefetching data for the next iteration
- Asynchronous memory operations

### Code Example
```cpp
// Double buffering index
register int buffer_idx = 0;

// Main loop over K dimension
for (int k_tile = 0; k_tile < (K + ${block_size_k} - 1) / ${block_size_k}; ++k_tile) {
    // Next buffer index for double buffering
    register int next_buffer_idx = 1 - buffer_idx;
    
    // Prefetch next tiles if not the last iteration
    if (k_tile < (K + ${block_size_k} - 1) / ${block_size_k} - 1) {
        // Prefetch data for the next iteration
        // ...
    }
    
    // Compute using the current buffer
    // ...
    
    // Switch buffers
    buffer_idx = next_buffer_idx;
}
```

### Performance Impact
- Hides memory latency
- Improves GPU utilization
- Increases overall throughput
- Typical speedup: 1.2-1.5x

## 4. Block Scheduling and Rasterization

### Overview
Block Scheduling and Rasterization is a technique that optimizes the scheduling of thread blocks and the rasterization of memory accesses.

### Implementation Details
- Grid-stride loops for efficient block scheduling
- Tuned block sizes for efficient rasterization
- Dynamic adjustment of grid dimensions based on GPU characteristics

### Code Example
```cpp
// Grid-stride loop for efficient block scheduling
for (int block_row = blockIdx.y; block_row < (M + ${block_size_m} - 1) / ${block_size_m}; block_row += gridDim.y) {
    for (int block_col = blockIdx.x; block_col < (N + ${block_size_n} - 1) / ${block_size_n}; block_col += gridDim.x) {
        // Process block
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Performance Impact
- Improves GPU utilization
- Reduces load imbalance
- Increases overall throughput
- Typical speedup: 1.2-1.5x

## 5. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation

### Overview
Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation is a technique that dynamically generates and compiles kernels at runtime based on the specific problem characteristics.

### Implementation Details
- Dynamic kernel generation based on matrix size and data type
- Runtime compilation using NVRTC
- Kernel caching for better performance
- Specialized kernels for different problem sizes

### Code Example
```cpp
// Set up JIT compilation parameters
JitCompileParams params;
params.kernel_name = use_tensor_cores ? "gemm_tensor_core_kernel" : "gemm_kernel";
params.use_fast_math = true;
params.use_tensor_cores = use_tensor_cores;
params.block_size_m = block_size_m;
params.block_size_n = block_size_n;
params.block_size_k = block_size_k;
params.use_unaligned_blocks = use_unaligned_blocks;

// Get or compile the kernel
auto& jit_compiler = get_jit_compiler();
auto kernel = jit_compiler.get_or_compile(kernel_code, params);
```

### Performance Impact
- Optimizes kernels for specific problem sizes
- Reduces compilation overhead through caching
- Increases overall throughput
- Typical speedup: 1.1-1.3x

## 6. Unaligned Block Sizes

### Overview
Unaligned Block Sizes is a technique that uses non-power-of-2 block sizes to better match the problem size and reduce padding.

### Implementation Details
- Support for specific unaligned block sizes (e.g., 112, 96, 56, 48)
- Dynamic selection of block sizes based on matrix dimensions
- Efficient algorithm to find the most efficient block size

### Code Example
```cpp
// Define a set of efficient unaligned block sizes
const std::vector<int> efficient_block_sizes = {
    32, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 192, 224, 256
};

// Find the most efficient block size for M dimension
int best_block_size_m = 32;  // Default minimum
int min_waste_m = block_size_m;  // Initialize with worst case

for (int size : efficient_block_sizes) {
    if (size >= 32 && size <= block_size_m) {  // Ensure minimum size and not larger than original
        // Calculate waste (padding) for this block size
        int waste = (size - (block_size_m % size)) % size;
        
        // If this block size results in less waste, use it
        if (waste < min_waste_m) {
            min_waste_m = waste;
            best_block_size_m = size;
        }
    }
}
```

### Performance Impact
- Reduces wasted computation and memory access
- Improves GPU utilization for non-power-of-2 matrix sizes
- Increases overall throughput
- Typical speedup: 1.1-1.3x

## 7. Tensor Cores Support

### Overview
Tensor Cores Support is a technique that utilizes the tensor cores available on modern NVIDIA GPUs (Volta and above) for accelerated matrix multiplication.

### Implementation Details
- Specialized kernel template for tensor cores
- Dynamic selection of tensor cores based on GPU capabilities
- Support for different data types (FP32, FP16)
- Optimized memory access patterns for tensor cores

### Code Example
```cpp
// Tensor core fragment declarations
nvcuda::wmma::fragment<nvcuda::wmma::matrix_a, 16, 16, 16, ${data_type}, nvcuda::wmma::row_major> a_frag;
nvcuda::wmma::fragment<nvcuda::wmma::matrix_b, 16, 16, 16, ${data_type}, nvcuda::wmma::row_major> b_frag;
nvcuda::wmma::fragment<nvcuda::wmma::accumulator, 16, 16, 16, ${data_type}> c_frag;

// Initialize accumulator fragment
nvcuda::wmma::fill_fragment(c_frag, 0.0f);

// Load fragments from shared memory
nvcuda::wmma::load_matrix_sync(a_frag, &tileA[buffer_idx][m][k], ${block_size_k});
nvcuda::wmma::load_matrix_sync(b_frag, &tileB[buffer_idx][k][n], ${block_size_n});

// Perform matrix multiplication
nvcuda::wmma::mma_sync(c_frag, a_frag, b_frag, c_frag);
```

### Performance Impact
- Dramatically accelerates matrix multiplication
- Improves energy efficiency
- Increases overall throughput
- Typical speedup: 3-5x
